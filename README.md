# Credit-Risk-Modeling-and-RAG-Enhanced-Explainable-Decision-Support-System
## 📖 Overview

This project builds an end-to-end credit risk decision support system using machine-learning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
A LightGBM Probability-of-Default (PD) model is trained on LendingClub data and deployed via Streamlit for real-time loan pre-screening.
RAG is used to provide policy-aware, explainable recommendations to support Credit Quality Assurance (QA) and underwriting decisions.

The goal is not just to predict default, but to support consistent, explainable, and policy-aligned credit decisions.

## 🏦 Business Problem

Traditional credit pre-screening often relies on:

- Hard rules (e.g., DTI < 40%)
- Manual reviews
- Inconsistent judgment across analysts

These approaches do not scale well and can miss emerging risk patterns.

This project addresses these issues by combining:

- Machine-learning based PD scoring
- Business risk banding
- LLM-based policy and market interpretation
